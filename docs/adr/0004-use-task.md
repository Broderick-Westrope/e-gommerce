# 4. Use Task

Date: 2023-08-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our Golang project requires an efficient and consistent way to automate essential development tasks, including building, testing, and linting. These tasks are crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring that our project follows best practices.

## Decision

We have decided to use Task (taskfile.dev) as the task runner to automate building, testing, and linting processes in our Golang project.

## Consequences

### Advantages

**Unified Task Automation**: Task provides a unified platform to define and run tasks, enabling us to perform building, testing, and linting using a single tool and configuration.

**Simplified Configuration**: With Task, we can define tasks in a single, easy-to-understand configuration file, reducing the complexity of managing separate build scripts.

**Dependency Management**: Task allows us to specify dependencies between tasks, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order. This is valuable when coordinating tasks like building before testing or linting.

**Integrated with golangci-lint**: Task can seamlessly integrate with tools like golangci-lint, enabling us to incorporate linting into our automated tasks, thus enhancing code quality.

### Challenges and Mitigations

**Learning Curve**: Although Task's syntax is relatively straightforward, team members new to Task might need time to become familiar with its concepts. To address this, we will provide documentation, tutorials, and hands-on training to facilitate adoption.

**External Tool Dependency**: Task introduces a dependency on an external tool. However, Task is well-maintained and widely used, minimizing the associated risks.

### Summary

The decision to use Task as our task runner for building, testing, and linting in our Golang project offers clear advantages. By utilizing Task's unified automation platform, we simplify task configuration, enhance coordination between tasks, and seamlessly integrate with tools like golangci-lint. While there might be a learning curve and a slight dependency on an external tool, these challenges can be managed through proper training and documentation. Overall, this decision aligns with our commitment to efficient, quality-focused development practices.
