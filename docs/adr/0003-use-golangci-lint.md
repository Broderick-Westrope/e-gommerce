# 3. Use golangci-lint

Date: 2023-08-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Maintaining code quality and consistency is essential for our software development process. We require an efficient linting tool integrated into our GitHub Actions workflow to ensure high code standards. This decision aims to address the need for an effective linting solution within our development pipeline.

## Decision

We have decided to use `golangci-lint` as the linting tool within our GitHub Actions workflow.

## Consequences

By choosing `golangci-lint` for our linting needs in GitHub Actions, several consequences and benefits are anticipated:

### Advantages

**Comprehensive Linting**: golangci-lint offers an extensive set of linting checks covering diverse aspects of Go code quality, including style, best practices, and error prevention. This thorough coverage ensures the adherence to a high level of code quality.

**Customizability**: golangci-lint's flexibility allows us to enable or disable specific linting checks according to our project's requirements. This customization ensures that the linting process is tailored to our codebase's specific needs.

**GitHub Actions Integration**: golangci-lint provides seamless integration with GitHub Actions through pre-built actions available in the GitHub Marketplace. This integration streamlines the setup and configuration of linting checks in our CI/CD pipeline.

**Active Maintenance**: As an actively maintained and community-driven tool, golangci-lint is regularly updated to align with the latest best practices and Go language features.

**Performance**: golangci-lint is designed for speed and efficiency, making it well-suited for integration into a CI/CD pipeline where rapid feedback is crucial.

**Plugin System**: golangci-lint's plugin system empowers us to extend its functionality with custom checks or incorporate third-party checks, addressing project-specific linting requirements effectively.

### Challenges and Mitigations

**Learning Curve**: While golangci-lint provides extensive features, there might be a learning curve for configuring and managing the tool effectively. To mitigate this, we will provide documentation and training resources to assist developers in leveraging golangci-lint efficiently.

**Integration Complexity**: Integrating golangci-lint into GitHub Actions might introduce complexities in the initial setup. However, the available pre-built actions in the GitHub Marketplace should alleviate this concern by simplifying the integration process.

**Maintenance Overhead**: With a rich set of linting checks and plugins, there is a potential for additional maintenance overhead. To manage this, we will establish a process to periodically review and update linting configurations as needed.

### Summary

In conclusion, the decision to use golangci-lint for linting within our GitHub Actions workflow is expected to lead to improved code quality, efficient CI/CD pipelines, and streamlined collaboration among developers. The anticipated benefits and potential risks will be continuously monitored to ensure a successful integration and maintenance process.
